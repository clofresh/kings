  You are in the western part of the docks.  The road continues to the east where you see a tiny park.  The north appears to be untraversible due to the dilapidated docks which appear to be slowly falling into the rocky water below.
  To the west, a few fishermen are telling fish tales to each other at the door of a large bait and tackle shop.  Next to the shop is a large warehouse where several workers haul crates filled with fish.  A small alley separates the two.   
  You also hear faint singing and laughter coming from a busy, nearby tavern.  Beyond that is a small distillery with several tall chimneys that continously release plumes of steam.  The road goes further south beyond that to an intersection in front of a wide building.
